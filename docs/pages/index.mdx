# Mod Publish Plugin

A modern Gradle plugin to publish Minecraft mods to a range of destinations.

### Features
- Supports CurseForge, Modrinth and Github
- Typesafe DSL to easily publish to multiple locations with minimal repetition 
- Retry on failure
- Dry run mode to try and increase confidence in your buildscript before releases
- Built with modern Gradle features
- Mod loader independent 

### Future plans
- Create some detailed documentation/working examples for Fabric and Forge + add some docs to the code. (Waiting on the project to be a bit more stable first)

### FAQ
- Why use Kotlin?
  - I wanted to explore using Kotlin for a larger project, as Gradle already includes Kotlin there should be little downside to the end user.
- Why do I need to specify the minecraft versions for both CurseForge and Modrinth?
  - Curseforge and Modrinth use different versioning for snapshots, thus they must be defined for each platform.
- Feature x or platform y is not supported
  - Please open an issue on this repo!
