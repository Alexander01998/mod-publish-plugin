## Basic example

![Discord example](/images/discord_example.png)

See the following minimal example showing how a message can be sent to a discord channel using a webhook.

```groovy
publishMods {
    // ...
    discord {
        webhookUrl = providers.environmentVariable("DISCORD_WEBHOOK")
    }
}
```

By default discord will publish a message with the changelog to the supplied webhook. A link to all of the platforms will also be included.

```groovy
publishMods {
    // ...
    discord {
        // Pass in the secret webhook URL. Required
        webhookUrl = providers.environmentVariable("DISCORD_WEBHOOK")

        // Set the username used to send the webhook, defaults to "Mod Publish Plugin"
        username = "My Cool Mod"

        // Set the avatar image url for the webhook, defaults to none.
        avatarUrl = "https://placekitten.com/500/500"

        // Set the content message, in this example a header is added before the changelog. Defaults to just the changelog
        content = changelog.map { "# A new version of my cool mod has been released! \n" + it}

        // If you wish to only link to certain platform you can do the following
        setPlatforms(platforms.curseforge, platforms.github)
    }
}
```
