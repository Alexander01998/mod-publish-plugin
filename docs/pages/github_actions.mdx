You can automate the building and publishing of your mod using GitHub Actions.
This is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to run scripts in response to events like pushing to a repository.

To use GitHub Actions, you need to create a `.github/workflows/release.yml` file in your repository.
```yml
name: Release
on: [workflow_dispatch] # Manual trigger

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/openjdk/jdk:21-ubuntu
      options: --user root
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ./gradlew build publishMods
        env:
          CURSEFORGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSEFORGE_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          MODRINTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MODRINTH_TOKEN }}
```
The above example is a simple workflow that will build and publish your mod when manually triggered via the GitHub web interface.
You must set the following secrets in your repository settings:
- `CURSEFORGE_API_KEY`: Your CurseForge API key. You can get this from your CurseForge account settings [here](https://legacy.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens).
- `MODRINTH_TOKEN`: Your Modrinth API key. You can get this from your Modrinth account settings [here](https://modrinth.com/settings/pats).

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically created by GitHub actions. If you arent publishing to any of these platforms you can omit the corresponding environment variable.
